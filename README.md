# DISTRIBUTED-OPERATING-SYSTEM-Gossip-Simulator-Gossip-Push-Sum-Protocol

Goal: The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of algorithms such as the Gossip Algorithm and Push-Sum Algorithm through a simulator based on actors written in Elixir. Full, Line, Random 2D Grid, 3D Torus Grid, HoneyComb, and Random Honeycomb topologies were implemented for both Push Sum and Gossip algorithms.

Technologies used: Elixir, Erlang, Atom
